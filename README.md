# Project Name

This is a project with two main parts: a InterviewProject built with React, Redux, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN, and a backend built with Express and Node.js. 

## Project Structure

- **InterviewProject**: A React-based InterviewProject using Redux for state management, styled with Tailwind CSS, and enhanced with ShadCN.
- **Backend**: A Node.js backend using Express for handling requests.

## Installation

### InterviewProject

1. Navigate to the `InterviewProject` folder.

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd InterviewProject
    npm install
    ```

3. To run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the React app and you can view it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder.

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3. To run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the Express server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

After setting up both the InterviewProject and backend, you can start interacting with the application. The InterviewProject communicates with the backend via API endpoints exposed by the Express server.
